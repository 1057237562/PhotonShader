## This is a shader pack for minecraft
Photon shader is a shader pack for Minecraft OptiFine and is uncompatiable with Iris. IT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, so it has some rendering bugs.
It reduces FPS by around 60 in 1.17.1 and gives relatively better graphic.

Each shader pack has a different style. Try it if you like my style.
